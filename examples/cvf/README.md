# CVF Applications

## CVF Listener
This example implements a very simple CVF listener application which receives CVF packets from the network, retrieves video data and writes them to stdout once the presentation time is reached.

For simplicity, this examples accepts only CVF H.264 packets, and the H.264 data must be composed of NAL and each NAL unit can not exceed 1400 bytes.

The H.264 data sent to output is in H.264 byte-stream format.

TSN stream parameters such as destination mac address are passed via command-line arguments. Run 'cvf-listener --help' for more information.

This example relies on the system clock to schedule video data samples for presentation. So make sure the system clock is synchronized with the PTP Hardware Clock (PHC) from your NIC and that the PHC is synchronized with the PTP time from the network. For further information on how to synchronize those clocks see ptp4l(8) and phc2sys(8) man pages.

The easiest way to use this example is by combining it with a GStreamer pipeline. We use GStreamer to read the H.264 byte-stream from stdin and present it. So, to play an H.264 video from a TSN strem and show it on a X display, you can do something like:

```
$ cvf-listener <args> | gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=/dev/stdin \
  ! decodebin ! videoconvert ! autovideosink
```

## CVF Talker
This example implements a very simple CVF talker application which reads an H.264 byte-stream from stdin, creates CVF packets and transmit them via network.

For simplicity, this example supports only NAL units in byte-stream format, and each NAL unit can not exceed 1400 bytes.

TSN stream parameters (e.g. destination mac address, traffic priority) are passed via command-line arguments. Run 'cvf-talker --help' for more information.

In order to have this example working properly, make sure you have configured FQTSS feature from your NIC according (for further information see tc-cbs(8)). Also, this example relies on system clock to set the AVTP timestamp so make sure it is synchronized with the PTP Hardware Clock (PHC) from your NIC and that the PHC is synchronized with the network clock. For further information see ptp4l(8) and phc2sys(8).

The easiest way to use this example is by combining it with a GStreamer pipeline. We use GStreamer to provide an H.264 stream that is sent to stdout, from where this example reads the stream. So, to generate an H.264 video to send via TSN network, you can do something like:
 
```
$ gst-launch-1.0 -e -q videotestsrc pattern=ball \
  ! video/x-raw,width=192,height=144 ! x264enc \
  ! video/x-h264,stream-format=byte-stream ! filesink location=/dev/stdout \
  | cvf-talker <args>
```
Note that the `x264enc` may be changed by any other H.264 encoder available, as long as it generates a byte-stream with NAL units no longer than 1400 bytes.
